<h2>About Make a Mask</h2>
<img src="jenn.png" alt="Jennifer Reyes" height="300px"/>
<p>My name is Jennifer Reyes and I am a Director of Clinical Operations for multiple Urgent Care and Family Practice Clinics in the Austin and surrounding areas. Like you have heard on the news, face MASKS are very limited for our staff. I created this site as a volunteer opportunity for our communities to help healthcare workers stay protected during the COVID19 pandemic.</p>

<p>At this time we believe we have THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of masks coming. Our #1 Goal right now... is to get the word out to the clinics and EMS/First responders on how to register to be on our distribution list. Please share with ANYONE you know in the healthcare community. You can even copy and paste the info, and send in a text.</p>

<p>If you are in the Austin and surrounding area in the healthcare field (clinic, dentist, homehealth, hospice, EMS first responder, etc) please register at this link to be placed on our distribution list. We ask that ONE person from your organization register to keep things organized.</p>

<h3>
	***IMPORTANT ***
</h3>
<p><strong>
	Our medical staff will never wear these as primary masks. Our goal and instructions we will share with other clinics on how to utilize the masks is to wear the sewn mask OVER the surgical or N95 mask. Kind of like a cover if you will. We can switch out the sewn mask in between each patient and prolong the life of our medical mask for a much longer period of time. Then, with the sewn masks, we can rinse...wash... and repeat. That‚Äôs why we need mass quantities of sewn masks. Lots of patients = Lots of masks. We are working in unexplored territory at this time, and some protection is better than NO protection. These clinics WILL RUN OUT of all standard issued PPE soon.</strong>

<p>Maybe you don‚Äôt have supplies or know how to sew ... you can still help us by sharing this page with your friends, family, and groups you partake in!</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt say THANK YOU enough to all the #MakeAMaskSewers .... from all the healthcare workers for participating! üôè</p>
