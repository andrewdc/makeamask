    <h4>Volunteers Log your Make-A-Mask Contribution</h4>

    <p>
      The reason it is important to log your masks is it will allow us to start
      the planning process as to where to allocate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF POSSIBLE: PLEASE SEND A FEW GALLON SIZE ZIPLOCK BAGS WITH THE MASKS AS
      WE ARE TRYING TO PACKAGE THESE IN SETS OF 25 TO DISPERSE OUT.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALSO, INCLUDE A NOTE IF THEY HAVE BEEN LAUNDERED “AFTER” THE SEWING
      PROCESS SO WE CAN EXPEDITE GETTING THEM OUT.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>WHERE ARE THE MASKS BEING DISTRIBUTED?</h3>
<p>
  Make-A-Mask was started in Austin, Texas by Jennifer Reyes, the Director of
  Clinical Operations, for the Victory Medical Urgent Care and Family Practice
  clinics. She reached out online as a desperate plea to get help from her local
  community in sewing masks and help solve her lack of PPE for her employees.
  Through the power of social media and a viral facebook page, there are
  thousands of people across the USA that have joined forces to drop off and/or
  ship sewn masks to the Austin area to help healthcare workers.
</p>

<h3>
  I’VE HEARD THAT FABRIC MASKS WON’T WORK OR HARBOR GERMS. HOW WILL THIS HELP
  MEDICAL STAFF?
</h3>
<p>
  Jennifer is a Director of Clinical Operations for family practice and urgent
  care clinics in the Austin area and personally struggles with having supplies
  for her own staff. It is advised that medical staff NEVER wear these as
  primary masks or only as a last resort. Our goal and instructions will be to
  share with clinics receiving masks on how to utilize the masks correctly and
  wear the sewn mask OVER the surgical or N95 mask. Kind of like a cover if you
  will. We can switch out the sewn mask in between each patient and prolong the
  life of our medical mask for a much longer period of time. Then, with the sewn
  masks, we can soak...launder... and repeat. That’s why we need mass quantities
  of sewn masks. Lots of patients = Lots of masks. We are working in unexplored
  territory at this time, and some protection is better than NO protection.
  These clinics WILL RUN OUT of all standard issued PPE soon.
</p>
<h3>WHAT IS THE BEST TYPE OF MATERIAL TO MAKE THE MASK OUT OF?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, we encourage you to use 100% cotton to make the masks. The medical
  staff will be wearing 2 masks (as stated above), so we want to make sure it’s
  something that is still comfortable and breathable. Some #MakeAMaskSewers have
  gotten creative with cotton, flannel, cloth diapers, T-shirts, pillowcases,
  etc. Be conscious about any additional “elements” you add to the masks. There
  are lots of patterns out there. The masks will need to be easily washed. In
  addition - the elastic is better than tie straps. Elastic is hard to come by
  right now, so we have seen #MakeAMaskSewers using elastic hair ties as a
  secondary option. We’ve heard about pipe cleaners being used to mold the
  bridge of the nose, and while genius, would make it difficult for laundering
  over and over.
</p>

<h3>
  I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MASKS...HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ONE TO MAKE
  ... BIGGER or SMALLER?
</h3>
<p>
  The bigger sewn masks that you have seen are meant to go over the N95 masks.
  The smaller sewn masks are meant to go over the surgical masks. To be honest,
  we need BOTH. Unfortunately, most of the clinics don’t normally stock large
  quantities of the N95 masks on a regular basis, so when it was time to quick
  order some… there were none to be found.. Therefore, most clinics are wearing
  surgical masks at this point. Bigger hospitals, when available, will be
  wearing more of the N95 masks. With that said, the government has made
  promises that more N95 masks are coming - SOMETIME. Our priority now is to
  supply the clinics, especially urgent care facilities, as that is where a
  majority of the walkin patients will be going for screening and testing.
</p>
<h3>WHAT IF I HAVE FABRIC AND OTHER SUPPLIES BUT I’M NOT ABLE TO SEW?</h3>

<p>At this time, because of the HUGE response from the #MakeAMaskSewers we are not accepting materials that have not been completed into masks. You are welcome to post your supplies on the Make-A-Mask facebook page to see if you can network with someone that needs supplies to sew.</p>

<h3>WHAT DOES MAKE-A-MASK NEED OUTSIDE OF SEWN MASKS? (check back often)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Currently we are looking for a company in Austin that we could connect with to do industrial washing of the masks as well as helping to coordinate the pick up of dirty masks and the drop off of cleans masks to the facilities.  
</li>

<li>We are also looking for a way to tap into the Austin Media Market. Bloggers, radio, News stations, print etc…  if you have any connections within that industry, please contact us through FB messenger or email at

<p>A message from Jennifer:</p>
<p>There are not words I can put down on paper that could possibly express my gratitude to all of those that are helping with this project.  I have shared the exciting news with my own employees at Victory Medical and networked with dozens and dozens of clinics already to find out their needs and coordinate a distribution plan. Thank you for HELPING US… HELP YOU. May all your families stay safe and in good health. My thoughts and well wishes are with each of you and your families.  🙏😷❤😊</p>
